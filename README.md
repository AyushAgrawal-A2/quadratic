# What is a Data Science Spreadsheet?

Quadratic is a Web-based spreadsheet application that runs both in the browser and as a standalone application (via Electron). 

Our goal for Quadrataic: The easiest way to pull your data from wherever it happens to be (SaaS, Database, CSV, API, etc) and allow you to work with your data using the most popular data science tools today (Python, Pandas, SQL, JS, Excel Formulas, etc).

## What can I do with Quadratic?
- Build internal tools
- Build dashboards
- Quickly mix data from different sources
- Explore your data for new insights
